# Code for the execution of use case 3 for the [convince project](https://convince-project.eu)


## running the code

inside the docker folder you can find the dockerfiles needed for executing the code. You can also find the dockerfiles pushed on [dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/layers/ste93/convince/qt_6.7.3_ubuntu24.04_jazzy_stable/images/sha256-cd36bca9d990b799acc80cf76106032a9bd0688a1d37ea4e29c4211e88bb9ffc)
