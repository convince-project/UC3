# Dialog Skill

The dialog pipeline is supposed to define the sequences of actions of a generic conversation between the robot and the user. In the context of Palazzo Madama, the robot is assumed to have conversations with visitors as a tour guide. For this reason, the dialog is settled as a question-answer dialog, where visitors are supposed to ask information about anything related the museum, the tour and the robot itself, while the robot is supposed to provide answers and wait for other questions or deciding when continuing the tour.

The dialog skill behavior follows the flow chart presented above:
- The starting state is `IDLE`
- If a tick is received, then the `WaitForInteract` state is supposed to wait for the interaction of the user and to pass it to the next state. If nothing is received, wait. When an interaction is received, go to the next state.
- The `ManageContext` state receives the interaction and extract information about the context. Based on this information, the pipeline may return some predefined replies, or deliver the request to a specific LLM. In order to understand the context, this state extract the language of the interaction and the type of the interaction. If the type of the interaction is an invite to start/end/continue the tour, get back to the `IDLE` state. Otherwise, go to the `SetLanguage` state.
- The `SetLanguage` state is supposed to set the language of the conversation, based on the language of the interaction. Here we set the language for both the text-to-speech and the scheduler components. After setting the language, go to the `CheckDuplicate` state.
- The `CheckDuplicate` state is supposed to recognize if the semantical meaning of the received question sentence has already been heard within the dialog:

    - If a similar question has previously been asked within the dialog session, the `ShortenReply` state is supposed to provide a resumed version of the previous answer, rather than replying the same information. After generating the answer, go to the `Speak` state.
    - If it's the first time that the question has been asked, then:
        - if the question is an invite to describe the room or to talk about the function of the room, then go to the `InterpretCommand` state, which is supposed to interpret the command and to provide a predefined answer. After generating the answer, go to the `Speak` state.
        - otherwise, go to the `Answer` state. This state provides LLMs that generate replies based on the context of the interaction. Until now, there are 2 LLMs: one that is specialized for questions related to Palazzo Madama and to the CONVINCE project, and another one that is specialized to manage questions related to R1 itself, as well as general questions. This design choice has been made to avoid allucinations and long execution times due to the length of the prompt that needs to be processed to include all the relevant information. After generating the answer, go to the `Speak` state.

- The `Speak` state is supposed to reproduce the audio of the answer generated by the previous state. After the speech, come back to the state `WaitForInteraction`.

# Components
The dialog skill represents a ROS2 node acting as a ROS2 Service Client, which interacts with the following components, implementing ROS2 Service Servers:
- **Dialog Component**: The dialog component provides the majoirity of the services required by the dialog skills, except for the speech synthesis, the speech recognition and the language settings. The dialog component is responsible to manage the dialog session, to provide the answer to the questions and to manage the dialog state. The dialog component is also responsible to manage the LLM, which is used to generate the answers.
- **Scheduler Component**: The scheduler component is responsible to provide the language of the conversation, based on the tour settings.

The Dialog Component also interacts with the following components:
- **Text-To-Speech Component**: The text to speech component is responsible to provide the speech synthesis service, which is used to generate the speech from the text.
- **Scheduler Component**: The scheduler component is responsible to provide the POI of the tour, and to change the PoI in case the user asks to continue the tour.
- **Speech-To-Text Component**: It is used to translate the voice interactions into text.

Below is a graphical representation of the components and their interactions. Here, grey boxes represent ROS2 nodes, orange boxes represent ROS2 services and blue boxes represent ROS2 topics. If the ROS2 service is on the left side of the box, it means that the service is provided by the node (i.e., the node implements them as ROS2 services server), otherwise it means that the service is required by the node (i.e., the node implements them as ROS2 service clients).

# Component-Skill-State Machine Communication
Below is a graphical representation of the communication between the component, the skill and the state machine. The arrows represent the communication between the entities. When a state of the state machine presents multiple input-output arrows, the arrows with the same color represent the sequential input-output flow of the state machine's communication with the skill.
